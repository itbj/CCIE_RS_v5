# CCIE_RS_v5

This is a set collection of lab exercise during my study to pursue CCIE certification. I will use combination of any emulator tools, but mostly I prefer to use GNS3 or IOU-VM for this vLab. I will update once I have finished my lab setup, please keep watch it!

Thanks & Regards,

Rakhmad
